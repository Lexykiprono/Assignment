                <h2>Causes of period poverty</h2>
            </div>
        <p><span style="color: gold">Period poverty</span>  mostly occurs because of having a low income. If you're only earning enough money to choose between food and heating, then period products quickly slip down the list of priorities.<br> Parents who menstruate may put their children's needs first and end up without suitable period products for themselves as a result.<p>
            <p>People who are homeless and much less likely to have access to period products due to low funds and needing to prioritise food and shelter. Also, homeless people are much less likely to have access to clean and safe washing facilities.</p>
            <p>A reason why a young person might experience period poverty is if their caregivers have enough money to buy period products but choose not to prioritise it, out of neglect and abuse.</p>
            <p>Another reason for period poverty can be losing access to an affordable supply.<br>An example of this has been during Covid-19, when people stockpiling products suddenly pushed the prices up, and meant that those who usually rely on ordering products from Amazon, for example, could no longer afford to do so. </p>
            <p> In the UK, the benefits that the most vulnerable people in society rely on have been cut back or scrapped in the last 10 years.<br> Often, benefit claimants will find that money is due to be paid to them but because of long waiting lists, ever-tightening criteria, and unhelpful bureaucracy, they go without payment for weeks or months, which forces them into poverty this may include period poverty.</p>

            <h3>Creating Awareness</h3>
            <p> Period poverty can lead to physical health problems. Without access to pads or tampons, girls may resort to using dirty rags or leaves during their periods. This can cause infections and other medical problems, especially in countries where female genital mutilation (FGM) still takes place.<br> There are also many girls in the world who do not have access to clean water, making it difficult for them to hygienically manage their period. </p>
            <p> Girls who cannot access sanitary items may be unable to attend school, as they don't want to risk bleeding through their clothes. Or, they may avoid attending due to a lack of facilities for changing to fresh period products, or because they struggle with painful headaches or cramps.</p>
            <p> In addition to missing out on school, girls who cannot afford period products also miss out on other opportunities.<br> They may be too embarrassed to participate in sports or other extracurricular activities, whether that's because of not wanting to get changed in front of others, or because they are worried about leaking. </p>
